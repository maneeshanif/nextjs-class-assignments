    In Next.js, I learned dynamic route navigation, route grouping (group routes), and nested routes. For APIs, you create a folder named api, and inside it, you write a file named route.ts. I also learned about dynamic rendering, static rendering, and most importantly, ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration/Rendering). I now understand how these rendering methods were done before version 13 using getStaticProps and getServerProps, and how they are handled in version 14. The only concepts I have left to cover are server actions, authentication in Next.js, and working with PostgreSQL using Prisma (ODM), with a little experience in Supabase ðŸ¤”. I plan to explore these topics in depth in the coming week, along with the remaining concepts.

Then, I plan to start working on a full-stack e-commerce website for Milestone 3 ðŸŽ‰, inshallah.
