        In Next.js, I learned dynamic route navigation, route grouping (group
        routes), and nested routes. For APIs, you create a folder named api, and
        inside it, you write a file named route.ts. I also learned about dynamic
        rendering, static rendering, and most importantly, ISR (Incremental
        Static Regeneration/Rendering). I now understand how these rendering
        methods were done before version 13 using getStaticProps and
        getServerProps, and how they are handled in version 14. The only
        concepts I have left to cover are server actions, authentication in
        Next.js, and working with PostgreSQL using Prisma (ODM), with a little
        experience in Supabase ðŸ¤”. I plan to explore these topics in depth in
        the coming week, along with the remaining concepts. Then, I plan to
        start working on a full-stack e-commerce website for Milestone 3 ðŸŽ‰,
        inshallah.
