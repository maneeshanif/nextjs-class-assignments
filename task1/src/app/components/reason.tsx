      <p style={inlineStyleReason}>As you know, I am participating in Teknofest Hackathon 2024 as a backend developer with my team. For this reason, I have been focusing on learning backend technologies. I have learned a lot, such as how to create HTTP and Express servers, server-side rendering with template engines like EJS, working with modules like fs and path, and using databases like MongoDB. I also now understand how APIs are made using the MVC architecture. Additionally, I am familiar with monolithic architecture, microservices, reverse proxies, load balancers like Nginx, how servers work, and socket.io. That is all that I have learned. I have been struggling with to conquer the backend, and thatswhy I was unable to submit your assignment on time. I am really sorry, sir. </p>
